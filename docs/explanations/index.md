# Explanations

Concept-oriented docs: why things work the way they do.

| Doc | What it explains |
|-----|-----------------|
| [EPG Coverage and the Long Tail](epg-coverage-and-long-tail.md) | Why 48k feeds → 3,232 DVR channels; what Gracenote fixes and doesn't; the pipeline in numbers. |
| [EPG Long-Tail Strategies](epg-long-tail-strategies.md) | How to find or build EPG for the other 40k channels: re-encode inheritance, FAST/AVOD merges, iptv-org DB, stream probing. Realistic coverage ceiling and implementation order. |

See also: [reference/epg-linking-pipeline.md](../reference/epg-linking-pipeline.md) for the matching tier design.
