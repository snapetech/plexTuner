# Copilot / path-scoped instructions

**Primary:** Follow [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and the [memory-bank/](../memory-bank/) (repo_map, commands, recurring_loops, opportunities).

**Path-scoped:**
- **`infra/`** (if present): Don’t handwave IaC; validate plan/apply and document any new resources.
- **`internal/`**: Respect VODFS contract and design in [docs/DESIGN.md](../docs/DESIGN.md); no transcoding in materializer.
