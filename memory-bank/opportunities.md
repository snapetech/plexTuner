# Opportunities (Continuous Improvement Backlog)

This is a lightweight backlog for improvements discovered during other work.
It exists to encourage quality gains without derailing the current task.

## Rules
- Prefer evidence: link to code, test output, perf numbers, or a specific risk.
- Do NOT expand scope mid-task unless it is small, low-risk, and clearly aligned.
- If an item needs a product/UX decision or significant effort, raise it to the user.
