## Entries

- Date: 2025-02-23
  Title: README redo, features.md, changelog.md, docs-gaps
  Summary:
    - Pulled from origin (gitlab.home); integrated latest main.
    - Rewrote README: full feature summary, comparison matrix (Plex Tuner vs xTeVe vs Threadfin), commands and env tables, repo layout.
    - Added docs/features.md: canonical feature list (input/indexing, catalog, tuner, EPG, VOD/VODFS, ops, not supported).
    - Added docs/CHANGELOG.md: history from git (merge, Plex Tuner content, template).
    - Added docs/docs-gaps.md: critical (missing internal/indexer), high (Plex setup, config reference, probe, RegisterTuner), medium (architecture, VODFS, XMLTV, multi-host), low (glossary, runbooks, Docker, systemd).
    - Updated docs/index.md with links to features, CHANGELOG, docs-gaps; memory-bank/current_task.md, known_issues.md (missing indexer), opportunities.md (indexer dependency).
  Verification:
    - N/A (format/lint: not run)
    - Build fails: missing internal/indexer (documented in known_issues and docs-gaps).
  Notes:
    - origin/main does not contain internal/indexer; main.go imports it. Documented as critical doc gap and known issue.
  Opportunities filed:
    - memory-bank/opportunities.md: Add or document internal/indexer dependency.
  Links:
    - README.md, docs/features.md, docs/CHANGELOG.md, docs/docs-gaps.md, docs/index.md
