# Skill: Asking Questions Without Derailing Work

Goal: ask when uncertainty is meaningful; otherwise proceed with safe defaults.

## Ask only when it matters
Ask a question if one of these is true:
- blocked: you cannot continue without an answer
- high-risk ambiguity: different interpretations could break behavior, data, security, or compatibility
- scope expansion: the "best" solution requires new deps, a bigger refactor, or new features
- user preference: UX/product trade-off with no obvious default

If none apply:
- proceed with a safe assumption
- document it in `memory-bank/current_task.md` ("Assumptions" section)

## How to ask (fast, high signal)
Use this format (keep it short):
- Q: <the decision point>
- Options: <2–3 realistic options>
- Recommendation: <one default> + why
- If no response: <what you will do by default>

## Anti-patterns
- asking permission for every micro-change
- asking questions that can be answered by reading the repo
- asking broad questions ("what do you want?") instead of decision points
