# Legacy Scripts

These scripts are retained for historical/manual testing context only.

They are not part of the supported Plex Tuner CLI surface, packaging flow, or CI verification path.

Examples:
- early HDHomeRun network mode smoke scripts
- environment-specific wrappers used during local/k3s troubleshooting

Prefer:
- `scripts/verify`
- `scripts/plextuner-local-test.sh`
- `scripts/build-test-packages.sh`
- `scripts/build-tester-release.sh`
