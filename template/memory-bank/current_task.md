## Assumptions & questions (only if uncertainty matters)

Assumptions (safe defaults you are proceeding with):
- [List any assumptions]

Questions (ONLY if blocked or high-risk ambiguity):
- [List any blocking questions]

## Opportunity radar (don't derail)

- If you notice out-of-scope improvements, record them in `memory-bank/opportunities.md`.

## Parallel agent tracking

## Self-check (quality bar — fill before claiming done)

- **Correctness:** [ ]
- **Tests:** [ ]
- **Risk:** [low/medium/high]
- **Performance impact:** [ ]
- **Security impact:** [ ]

## Decisions (single source of truth)

- If you make a **durable** decision, promote it to **ADR** (`docs/adr/`) or **memory-bank**.
- If you're **unsure whether it's durable**, don't promote yet — note it in Assumptions.

## Docs (done = doc update when behavior changes)

- If you changed **behavior, interfaces, or config:** update or create **one** doc in `docs/`; add cross-links.
- If you **noticed doc gaps** but it's out of scope: file in `memory-bank/opportunities.md`.
